# Vocal-Vision

This project extends NotebookLM by converting textual queries into engaging video podcasts with talking male and female avatars for input. By integrating advanced AI technologies such as speaker MP3 audio files to submit and video generation, the platform enhances NotebookLMâ€™s capabilities, adding a visual dimension to information sharing. A website hosts this using frontend (JS, CSS, HTML) and backend (MongoDB Atlas, Python Flask).

Key Features:
Input text or audio queries
Upload images of speakers
Generate personalized video podcasts with AI-generated talking avatars
Supports up to 14 languages
the agile methodology used to update this project with more languages and longer video duration

Award: This project won me a sponsored track, "Best use of Notebook LM," to win prizes at DivHacks at Columbia University.
