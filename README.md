# Vocal-Vision

## Description

This project extends NotebookLM by converting textual queries into engaging video podcasts with talking male and female avatars for input. By integrating advanced AI technologies such as speaker MP3 audio files to submit and video generation, the platform enhances NotebookLMâ€™s capabilities, adding a visual dimension to information sharing. A website hosts this using frontend (JS, CSS, HTML) and backend (MongoDB Atlas, Python Flask).
